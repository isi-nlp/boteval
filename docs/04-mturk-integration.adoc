= MTurk Integration

* MTurk integration is achieved via link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_ExternalQuestionArticle.html[ExternalQuestion^]
* However, ExternalQuestion requires hosting our webservice over HTTPS, which requires SSL certificate. See <<#nginx>>. 


TIP: When the task is done, we need to submit a form back to MTurk informing the completion. So, Mturk worker gets an additional screen at the end of task where they click a button to notify the task completion to mturk. 

In the current version of this system, we do not automatically launch HITs on Mturk, instead we provide an option to Admin user.


To launch HITs on mturk, follow these steps

. Login as admin user (See <<#quickstart>>)
. Go to _Admin Dashboard > Topics > Launch on Mturk or Mturk Sandbox_ (depending on cofig)
