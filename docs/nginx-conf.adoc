= Nginx as Reverse Proxy: A sample config


.Summary:
* Running https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=ubuntufocal[Certbot^] generated a sample nginx config at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` with `ssl_*` fields configured. 
* I have added reverse proxy for location `/boteval` -> `http://127.0.0.1:7070/boteval` along with necessary proxy headers to make session/logins work.

The below nginx setting was tested to be working when flask app is bound to `http://127.0.0.1:7070/boteval` on an AWS/EC2 instance whose IP is mapped (via DNS A-record) to `dev.gowda.ai`, and ports 80(HTTP), 443(HTTPS) are open to the public.
